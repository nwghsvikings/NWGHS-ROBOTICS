            We are the Robo Vikings #9990, a team founded in 2015 by our teacher and mentor, Ray Alford. Since then, we
            have
            remained dedicated to the FIRST Tech Challenge. Over the years, more than 95% of our team members have gone
            on
            to attend top colleges like NCSU and UNC Chapel Hill, or have chosen alternative paths such as joining the
            military.
        </p>

        <p id="introtext2">
            While our budget has always fluctuated, this year, we are focusing on raising funds independently. We are
            proud
            to have gained sponsorships from organizations like PPG and Terracon and aim to establish long-term
            partnerships
            with recurring sponsors. We hope to gain valuable industry insight and expand our network through these
            connections.
        </p>

        <p id="introtext3">
            Thanks to our team's hard work and determination, we have qualified for the State
            Championship five times. We are deeply grateful to all our past and present team members for their
            commitment to
            the Robo Vikings.
        </p>
